## ðŸš€ About This Project

- **Purpose**: This project leverages 
feature engineering, a trained machine learning model, and a web-based interface to deliver a 
user-friendly experience.



- **OBJECTIVES:**
The primary objectives of the project are:
1. To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting loan eligibility.
2. To design a web-based application for users to interact with the prediction system.
3. To provide detailed insights, including EMI breakdowns for approved loans and 
reasons for rejection.
4. To enhance user experience through intuitive design and dynamic feedback.
- **Status**:Completed!..

- **FEATURES:**
1. Loan Prediction: Determines loan eligibility based on user inputs.
2. EMI Calculation: For approved loans, calculates monthly payments based on interest 
rate and loan term.
3. Rejection Reasons: Provides reasons for disapproval, such as high DTI ratio.
4. Loan Suggestions: Recommends lower loan amounts for better eligibility.
5. Dynamic Feedback: Uses toast notifications to enhance user experience.

- **RESULTS AND INSIGHTS**
ï‚· Sample Prediction (Approved):
- Input: Applicant Income: 50,000; Loan Amount: 2 Lakhs; Loan Term: 60 
months.
- Output: Loan Approved! EMI: â‚¹4,140 per month.
- DTI Ratio: 24.5%.
ï‚· Sample Prediction (Not Approved):
- Input: Applicant Income: 20,000; Loan Amount: 5 Lakhs; Loan Term: 120 
months.
- Output: Loan Not Approved. DTI Ratio: 125% (Risky).
- Suggestion: Consider reducing the loan amount to â‚¹2 Lakhs.

- **FUTURE SCOPE**
- Add dynamic interest rates based on market conditions.
- Include additional loan types (e.g., home loans, car loans).
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS for scalability.
- Enable multi-language support for broader accessibility.
