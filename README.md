## 📊 **Results and Insights**

### ✅ **Sample Prediction (Approved)**:
- **Input**: Applicant Income: ₹50,000; Loan Amount: ₹2 Lakhs; Loan Term: 60 months.  
- **Output**: Loan Approved!  
  - EMI: ₹4,140/month.  
  - DTI Ratio: 24.5%.  

### ❌ **Sample Prediction (Not Approved)**:
- **Input**: Applicant Income: ₹20,000; Loan Amount: ₹5 Lakhs; Loan Term: 120 months.  
- **Output**: Loan Not Approved.  
  - DTI Ratio: 125% (Risky).  
  - **Suggestion**: Consider reducing the loan amount to ₹2 Lakhs.
